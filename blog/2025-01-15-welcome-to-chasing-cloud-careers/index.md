## Our Story

Chasing Cloud Careers was born from a simple belief: **everyone deserves access to high-quality engineering education, regardless of their financial situation**. We've curated the best free resources from across the internet, organized them into structured learning paths, and built a supportive community around shared learning and growth.

This isn't about selling you courses or certifications. This is about empowering you with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to chase your engineering dreams.

## Six Comprehensive Learning Paths

We've designed six distinct learning paths, each tailored to different engineering disciplines and career goals:

### Support Engineering
Perfect for those who love problem-solving and helping others. Learn technical troubleshooting, customer success principles, and the art of turning frustrated users into happy customers. This path is ideal for career changers who want to enter tech with strong communication skills.

**What you'll master:**
- Technical troubleshooting methodologies
- Customer communication and empathy
- Product knowledge and documentation
- Escalation management and team collaboration

### Linux Engineering
Dive deep into the backbone of modern infrastructure. Master command-line interfaces, system administration, and the skills that power everything from web servers to cloud platforms. Linux knowledge is foundational for almost every other engineering discipline.

**What you'll master:**
- Command line proficiency and shell scripting
- System administration and user management
- Network configuration and security
- Server management and performance optimization

### Cloud Engineering
Learn to build, deploy, and manage applications in the cloud. Explore AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform while mastering infrastructure as code, containerization, and cloud-native architectures. This is where the future of infrastructure is heading.

**What you'll master:**
- Multi-cloud platform expertise (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform and CloudFormation
- Containerization with Docker and Kubernetes
- Cloud security and cost optimization

### DevOps Engineering
Bridge the gap between development and operations. Learn to automate deployments, manage CI/CD pipelines, and create the systems that allow software teams to ship faster and more reliably. DevOps engineers are in high demand across all industries.

**What you'll master:**
- CI/CD pipeline design and implementation
- Container orchestration and microservices
- Monitoring, logging, and observability
- Infrastructure automation and configuration management

### AI Engineering
Step into the future of technology. Learn to build, deploy, and maintain AI systems in production. This isn't just about training models - it's about creating the infrastructure and processes that make AI applications reliable and scalable.

**What you'll master:**
- MLOps and model lifecycle management
- AI infrastructure and deployment strategies
- Model monitoring and performance optimization
- Ethical AI practices and governance

### Research Engineering
For those who want to push the boundaries of what's possible. Learn to bridge cutting-edge research with practical implementation, working at the intersection of academia and industry. Partner with our **AJ (Average Joes) Labs** community for real-world research projects.

**What you'll master:**
- Research methodology and experimental design
- Academic paper implementation and analysis
- Prototype development and proof-of-concept creation
- Collaboration between research and engineering teams
