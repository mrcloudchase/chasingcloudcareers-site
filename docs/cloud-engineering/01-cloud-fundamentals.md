# Cloud Computing Fundamentals

Master the essential concepts, terminology, and foundational knowledge needed to work effectively with cloud platforms.

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

### Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing

**On-Demand Self-Service:**
- Users can provision computing capabilities automatically
- No human interaction required with service providers
- Resources available when needed

**Broad Network Access:**
- Services available over the network
- Accessible through standard mechanisms
- Works with various client platforms (mobile, laptop, workstation)

**Resource Pooling:**
- Provider's computing resources serve multiple consumers
- Resources dynamically assigned based on demand
- Location independence (users don't control exact location)

**Rapid Elasticity:**
- Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released
- Scale rapidly outward and inward with demand
- Appears unlimited to the consumer

**Measured Service:**
- Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use
- Monitoring, controlling, and reporting provide transparency
- Pay-per-use or subscription models

### Cloud Service Models

Understanding the three main service models is crucial for cloud engineering:

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):**
```
What you manage: Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, OS
What cloud provides: Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking

Examples: AWS EC2, Azure VMs, Google Compute Engine
Use cases: Virtual machines, storage, networking
```

**Platform as a Service (PaaS):**
```
What you manage: Applications, Data
What cloud provides: Runtime, Middleware, OS, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking

Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service, Google App Engine
Use cases: Application development and deployment platforms
```

**Software as a Service (SaaS):**
```
What you manage: Data (sometimes)
What cloud provides: Everything else

Examples: Office 365, Salesforce, Gmail, Dropbox
Use cases: Ready-to-use applications
```

### Cloud Deployment Models

**Public Cloud:**
- Services offered over the public internet
- Available to anyone who wants to purchase them
- Owned and operated by third-party cloud service providers
- Examples: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform

**Private Cloud:**
- Computing services offered over a private IT infrastructure
- Used exclusively by a single business or organization
- Can be physically located on-site or hosted by third-party provider
- Greater control and security

**Hybrid Cloud:**
- Combines public and private clouds
- Data and applications can be shared between them
- Provides greater flexibility and deployment options
- Allows workloads to move between environments

**Multi-Cloud:**
- Uses multiple cloud computing services from different providers
- Avoids vendor lock-in
- Optimizes for different services from different providers
- Increases complexity but provides flexibility

```bash
# VPC Components:
Subnets: Network segments within VPC
Route Tables: Control traffic routing
Internet Gateways: Internet access
NAT Gateways: Outbound internet for private subnets
Security Groups: Virtual firewalls
```

**IP Addressing:**
```bash
# Private IP Ranges (RFC 1918):
10.0.0.0/8     (10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255)
172.16.0.0/12  (172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255)
192.168.0.0/16 (192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255)

# CIDR Notation Examples:
10.0.0.0/16    # 65,536 IP addresses
10.0.1.0/24    # 256 IP addresses
10.0.1.0/28    # 16 IP addresses
```

**Load Balancing:**
```bash
# Types of Load Balancers:
Application Load Balancer (Layer 7): HTTP/HTTPS traffic
Network Load Balancer (Layer 4): TCP/UDP traffic
Classic Load Balancer: Legacy, basic load balancing

# Load Balancing Algorithms:
Round Robin: Distribute requests evenly

## Cloud Security Fundamentals

Security in the cloud follows a shared responsibility model between the cloud provider and the customer.

### Shared Responsibility Model

**Cloud Provider Responsibilities:**
- Physical security of data centers
- Infrastructure security
- Network controls
- Host operating system patching
- Hypervisor security

**Customer Responsibilities:**
- Data encryption
- Network traffic protection
- Operating system updates
- Identity and access management
- Application-level security

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)

IAM controls who can access what resources in your cloud environment.

**Core IAM Concepts:**
```bash
# Users: Individual people or services
# Groups: Collections of users
# Roles: Set of permissions that can be assumed
# Policies: Documents that define permissions

# Principle of Least Privilege:
Grant only the minimum permissions needed for a task
```

**AWS IAM Example:**
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
```bash
# MFA adds extra security layer
# Something you know (password) + Something you have (token)
# Required for privileged accounts
# Examples: SMS, authenticator apps, hardware tokens
```

### Network Security

**Security Groups and NACLs:**
```bash
# Security Groups (Stateful):
- Act as virtual firewalls for instances
- Allow rules only (deny is implicit)
- Stateful (return traffic automatically allowed)

# Network ACLs (Stateless):
- Subnet-level security
- Allow and deny rules
- Stateless (must explicitly allow return traffic)
```

**VPN and Private Connectivity:**
```bash
# Site-to-Site VPN:
Connect on-premises network to cloud VPC
Encrypted tunnel over internet

# Direct Connect / ExpressRoute / Cloud Interconnect:
Dedicated private connection to cloud provider
Higher bandwidth, lower latency, more predictable
```

### Data Encryption

**Encryption at Rest:**
```bash
# Encrypts data stored on disk
# Examples:
AWS: S3 Server-Side Encryption, EBS encryption
Azure: Storage Service Encryption, Disk encryption
GCP: Cloud Storage encryption, Persistent Disk encryption
```

**Encryption in Transit:**
```bash
# Encrypts data moving between locations
# Protocols: TLS/SSL, IPSec VPN
# Examples:
HTTPS for web traffic
TLS for database connections
VPN for site-to-site communication
```
