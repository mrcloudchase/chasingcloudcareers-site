# Getting Started with Cloud Engineering

Welcome to your **Cloud Engineering** learning journey! This comprehensive path will take you from cloud fundamentals to advanced cloud architecture and operations.

## What You'll Learn

- **Cloud Fundamentals**: Core concepts across AWS, Azure, and GCP
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, CloudFormation, ARM templates
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes, and container orchestration
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated deployment and testing
- **Monitoring & Observability**: CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Stackdriver
- **Security**: Cloud security best practices and compliance

## Prerequisites

- Basic networking knowledge
- Command line familiarity (Linux/Windows)
- Understanding of virtualization concepts
- Basic programming skills (Python, Bash, or PowerShell)

## Complete Learning Path Structure

- Configuration management with Ansible
- **Hands-on**: Multi-environment infrastructure deployment with GitOps pipeline

### Module 4: Container Orchestration (Weeks 13-16)
**[Container Orchestration →](./04-container-orchestration.md)**
- Container fundamentals and Docker mastery
- Kubernetes architecture and core concepts
- Pod management, services, ingress, and storage
- Cloud-managed Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS)
- Container security and best practices
- **Hands-on**: Deploy full-stack application with CI/CD pipeline to Kubernetes

### Module 5: Multi-Cloud Architecture (Weeks 17-20)
**[Multi-Cloud Architecture →](./05-multi-cloud-architecture.md)**
- Multi-cloud vs hybrid cloud strategies
- Cloud-agnostic application design patterns
- Multi-cloud infrastructure with Terraform
