### Managing Customer Expectations

**Setting Realistic Timelines**
```
Estimation Framework:
├─ Best Case Scenario (20% probability)
├─ Most Likely Scenario (60% probability)  
├─ Worst Case Scenario (20% probability)
└─ Communicated Timeline (Worst Case + 25% buffer)

Example:
Technical Assessment:
• Best case: 30 minutes (simple config change)
• Most likely: 2 hours (requires code deployment)
• Worst case: 4 hours (needs database migration)
• Buffer: +1 hour (for unexpected complications)

Customer Communication:
"We expect to resolve this issue within 5 hours. We'll provide 
updates every hour and will notify you immediately if we can 
resolve it sooner."
```

**Handling Uncertainty**
```
When You Don't Know:
❌ "We're not sure what's wrong or how long it will take."
✅ "We're actively investigating the root cause. Based on similar 
   issues, we typically resolve these within 2-4 hours. We'll 
   have a more specific timeline within 30 minutes."

When Timeline Changes:
❌ "It's taking longer than expected."
✅ "We've discovered additional complexity that requires more time. 
   Our new estimated resolution time is [X]. Here's what we've 
   learned and what we're doing differently..."

When Asking for Patience:
❌ "Please be patient while we work on this."
✅ "We understand this is impacting your business. Our team is 
   fully focused on resolution, and we're taking these specific 
   steps: [list actions]. We'll update you in 30 minutes."
```

**Task:** Design a customer health scoring system for a SaaS platform.

**Requirements:**
- Include usage, support, and satisfaction metrics
- Weight different factors appropriately
- Create actionable thresholds
- Design intervention strategies for each health level

**Sample Implementation:**
```javascript
const calculateCustomerHealth = (customer) => {
  const metrics = {
    // Usage metrics (40% weight)
    loginFrequency: customer.loginsLastMonth / 30, // 0-1 scale
    featureAdoption: customer.featuresUsed / customer.featuresAvailable,
    dataVolume: Math.min(customer.recordsProcessed / customer.expectedVolume, 1),
    
    // Support metrics (30% weight)
    ticketVolume: Math.max(0, 1 - (customer.ticketsLastMonth / 10)),
    resolutionSatisfaction: customer.avgCSAT / 5,
    escalationRate: Math.max(0, 1 - (customer.escalationsLastMonth / 5)),
    
    // Business metrics (30% weight)
    paymentHealth: customer.paymentStatus === 'current' ? 1 : 0,
    contractUtilization: customer.actualUsage / customer.contractedUsage,
    growthTrend: customer.usageGrowthRate > 0 ? 1 : 0.5
  };
  
  const weights = {
    loginFrequency: 0.15,
    featureAdoption: 0.15,
    dataVolume: 0.10,
    ticketVolume: 0.10,
    resolutionSatisfaction: 0.10,
    escalationRate: 0.10,
    paymentHealth: 0.10,
    contractUtilization: 0.10,
    growthTrend: 0.10
  };
  
  return Object.keys(metrics).reduce((score, metric) => {
    return score + (metrics[metric] * weights[metric] * 100);
  }, 0);
};
```

### Exercise 3: Incident Post-Mortem Analysis

**Scenario:** API outage lasted 3 hours, affected 60% of customers, caused by failed database migration.

**Your Tasks:**
1. **Conduct root cause analysis** using the 5 Whys technique
2. **Assess business impact** and calculate costs
3. **Develop prevention strategies** and implementation plan
4. **Create customer communication** for post-incident follow-up

**Sample Analysis Framework:**
```
Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys):

Problem: API outage for 3 hours
Why? Database migration failed and couldn't be rolled back quickly
Why? Migration script had syntax errors not caught in testing
Why? Testing was done on smaller dataset that didn't expose the issue
Why? Test environment didn't match production data volume and complexity
Why? No process for maintaining test data parity with production

Root Cause: Inadequate test environment and data management processes

Prevention Strategies:
1. Implement production-like test environments
