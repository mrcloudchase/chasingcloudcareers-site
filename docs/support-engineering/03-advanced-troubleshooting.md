# Advanced Troubleshooting

Master sophisticated problem-solving techniques, performance optimization, security analysis, and complex system debugging that separate expert support engineers from the rest.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Apply advanced debugging methodologies for complex issues
- Analyze system performance bottlenecks and optimize solutions
- Investigate security incidents and implement preventive measures
- Use advanced monitoring and observability tools
- Handle multi-system integration problems
- Lead incident response and post-mortem analysis

## 1. Advanced Debugging Methodologies

### The Scientific Method for Complex Issues

**Hypothesis-Driven Debugging**
```
1. Observe the problem symptoms
2. Form hypotheses about root causes
3. Design tests to validate/invalidate hypotheses
4. Execute tests systematically
5. Analyze results and refine hypotheses
6. Repeat until root cause identified
```

**Example: Intermittent Application Crashes**
```
Observation: Application crashes randomly, no clear pattern
Hypotheses:
- Memory leak causing OOM crashes
- Race condition in concurrent code
- External dependency timeout
- Database connection pool exhaustion

Tests:
- Monitor memory usage over time
- Enable debug logging for threading
- Test with external dependencies mocked
- Monitor database connection metrics
```

### Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Framework

**The 5 Whys Technique**
```
Problem: Website is slow

Why? Database queries are taking 10+ seconds
Why? Missing indexes on frequently queried columns
Why? Recent schema changes didn't include index updates
Why? Deployment process doesn't validate index requirements
Why? No automated performance testing in CI/CD pipeline

Root Cause: Missing performance validation in deployment process
Solution: Add automated performance tests and index validation
```

**Fishbone Diagram Analysis**
```
Problem: API Timeouts

Categories to investigate:
- People: Team knowledge, training, procedures
- Process: Deployment, monitoring, incident response
- Technology: Infrastructure, code, dependencies
- Environment: Network, hardware, external services

Example Investigation:
Technology Branch:
├── Code Issues
│   ├── Inefficient algorithms
│   ├── Memory leaks
│   └── Blocking operations
├── Infrastructure
│   ├── Insufficient resources
│   ├── Network latency
│   └── Load balancer config
└── Dependencies
    ├── Third-party API limits
    ├── Database performance
    └── Cache misses
```

### Advanced Log Analysis

**Correlation Analysis**
```bash
# Correlate errors across multiple services
# Service A logs
grep "2024-01-15 14:3[0-9]" service-a.log | grep ERROR

# Service B logs  
grep "2024-01-15 14:3[0-9]" service-b.log | grep ERROR

# Database logs
grep "2024-01-15 14:3[0-9]" mysql-error.log

# Load balancer logs
grep "2024-01-15 14:3[0-9]" nginx-access.log | grep " 5[0-9][0-9] "
```

**Pattern Recognition**
```bash
# Identify error patterns
awk '{print $1, $2, $9}' access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

# Time-based analysis
grep "ERROR" application.log | awk '{print $1, $2}' | sort | uniq -c

# User behavior patterns
grep "user_id=" application.log | sed 's/.*user_id=\([0-9]*\).*/\1/' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

**Log Aggregation and Analysis**
```bash
# Using ELK Stack concepts (even with basic tools)
# Extract, Transform, Load approach

# Extract relevant data
grep "API_CALL" application.log | \
awk '{print $1, $2, $7, $9, $10}' > api_calls.txt

# Transform data for analysis
cat api_calls.txt | \
awk '{
    date=$1" "$2
    endpoint=$3
    status=$4
    response_time=$5
    print date","endpoint","status","response_time
}' > api_calls.csv

# Load into analysis (or Excel/Google Sheets)
# Analyze patterns, trends, outliers
```

## 2. Performance Analysis and Optimization

### Application Performance Monitoring (APM)

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
```
Response Time Metrics:
- Average response time: < 200ms (web), < 50ms (API)
- 95th percentile: < 500ms
- 99th percentile: < 1000ms
- Maximum response time: < 5000ms

Throughput Metrics:
- Requests per second (RPS)
- Transactions per minute (TPM)
- Concurrent users supported

Error Metrics:
- Error rate: < 0.1%
- 4xx errors: Client-side issues
- 5xx errors: Server-side issues

Resource Utilization:
- CPU usage: < 70% average
- Memory usage: < 80% of available
- Disk I/O: < 80% capacity
- Network bandwidth: < 70% capacity
```

**Performance Profiling**
```bash
# CPU profiling
# Using perf (Linux)
perf record -g ./application
perf report

# Using top/htop for real-time monitoring
top -p $(pgrep application)
htop -p $(pgrep application)

# Memory profiling
# Using valgrind
valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full ./application

# Using system tools
pmap -x PID
cat /proc/PID/status
cat /proc/PID/smaps

# I/O profiling
# Using iotop
iotop -p PID

# Using strace for system calls
strace -p PID -e trace=file
strace -p PID -e trace=network
```

**Database Performance Optimization**
```sql
-- Query performance analysis
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM users 
WHERE created_at > '2024-01-01' 
AND status = 'active';

-- Index optimization
-- Before: Full table scan
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123;

-- After: Add index
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_id ON orders(customer_id);

-- Composite indexes for complex queries
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_status_date 
ON orders(customer_id, status, created_at);

-- Query optimization examples
-- Inefficient: N+1 query problem
SELECT * FROM users;
-- For each user: SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = ?

-- Efficient: Join query
SELECT u.*, o.* FROM users u 
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;

-- Pagination optimization
-- Inefficient: OFFSET becomes slow with large offsets
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY id LIMIT 20 OFFSET 10000;

-- Efficient: Cursor-based pagination
SELECT * FROM products WHERE id > 10000 ORDER BY id LIMIT 20;
```

**Caching Strategies**
```bash
# Redis caching examples
# Cache frequently accessed data
redis-cli SET "user:123" '{"name":"John","email":"john@example.com"}'
redis-cli GET "user:123"

# Cache with expiration
redis-cli SETEX "session:abc123" 3600 "user_data"

# Cache invalidation patterns
redis-cli DEL "user:123"
redis-cli FLUSHDB  # Clear all cache

# Application-level caching
# Cache expensive computations
# Cache database query results
# Cache API responses
# Cache rendered HTML/templates
```

### Load Testing and Capacity Planning

**Load Testing with Free Tools**
```bash
# Apache Bench (ab)
ab -n 1000 -c 10 http://example.com/api/users
# -n: total requests
# -c: concurrent requests

# wrk (modern load testing tool)
wrk -t12 -c400 -d30s http://example.com/api/users
# -t: threads
# -c: connections
# -d: duration

# curl-based load testing
for i in {1..100}; do
    curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -o /dev/null -s http://example.com/api/users &
done
wait

# JMeter (GUI-based)
# Create test plans with:
# - Ramp-up scenarios
# - Different user behaviors
# - Response validation
# - Performance assertions
```

**Capacity Planning Calculations**
```
Current Performance:
- Server handles 100 RPS at 70% CPU
- Peak traffic: 500 concurrent users
- Average session: 10 requests

Capacity Planning:
- Target: 1000 concurrent users
- Required RPS: 1000 users × 10 requests / 60 seconds = 167 RPS
- Required servers: 167 RPS / 100 RPS = 2 servers (with headroom: 3 servers)

Growth Planning:
- Monthly growth: 20%
- 6-month projection: 1000 × 1.2^6 = 2986 users
- Infrastructure scaling plan needed
```

## 4. Advanced Monitoring and Observability

### The Three Pillars of Observability

**Metrics**
```bash
# System metrics
# CPU, Memory, Disk, Network utilization
# Application metrics
# Response time, throughput, error rate
# Business metrics
# User registrations, transactions, revenue

# Prometheus query examples (PromQL)
# CPU usage
100 - (avg by (instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])) * 100)

# Memory usage
(node_memory_MemTotal_bytes - node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes) / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes * 100

# HTTP request rate
rate(http_requests_total[5m])

# Error rate
rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]) / rate(http_requests_total[5m])
```

**Logs**
```bash
# Structured logging best practices
# JSON format for machine readability
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "service": "user-api",
  "trace_id": "abc123",
  "user_id": "user456",
  "message": "Database connection failed",
  "error": "connection timeout after 30s",
  "duration_ms": 30000
}

# Log aggregation with ELK Stack concepts
# Elasticsearch: Store and index logs
# Logstash: Process and transform logs  
# Kibana: Visualize and search logs

# Basic log analysis queries
# Find all errors in last hour
grep "$(date -d '1 hour ago' '+%Y-%m-%d %H'):" application.log | grep ERROR

# Top error messages
grep ERROR application.log | awk -F'"message":"' '{print $2}' | awk -F'"' '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

**Traces**
```bash
# Distributed tracing concepts
# Track requests across multiple services
# Identify bottlenecks in microservices
# Understand service dependencies

# Jaeger tracing example flow
Request ID: abc123
├── Frontend Service (50ms)
├── User Service (20ms)
│   └── Database Query (15ms)
├── Order Service (100ms)
│   ├── Database Query (30ms)
│   └── Payment Service (60ms)
│       └── External API (45ms)
└── Notification Service (10ms)

# Identify slowest component: Payment Service → External API
```

### Alerting and Incident Management

**Effective Alerting Strategy**
```yaml
# Alert severity levels
Critical: Service completely down, immediate response required
High: Significant degradation, response within 15 minutes
Medium: Minor issues, response within 1 hour
Low: Informational, response within 24 hours

# Alert examples
- name: HighErrorRate
  condition: error_rate > 5%
  severity: High
  description: "Error rate above 5% for 5 minutes"
  
- name: DatabaseDown
  condition: database_up == 0
  severity: Critical
  description: "Database is not responding"
  
- name: HighMemoryUsage
  condition: memory_usage > 90%
  severity: Medium
  description: "Memory usage above 90% for 10 minutes"
```

**On-Call Best Practices**
```
Runbook Structure:
1. Alert Description
   - What the alert means
   - Potential impact on users
   - Severity and urgency

2. Initial Response
   - First steps to take
   - How to assess the situation
   - When to escalate

3. Investigation Steps
   - Where to look for clues
   - Common causes and solutions
   - Diagnostic commands to run

4. Resolution Steps
   - Step-by-step fix procedures
   - Verification steps
   - Communication templates

5. Post-Incident
   - What to document
   - Follow-up actions required
   - Prevention measures
```

**Incident Communication**
```
Status Page Updates:
"We are investigating reports of slow response times on our API. 
We will provide an update within 30 minutes."

"We have identified the cause of the API slowness and are 
implementing a fix. Expected resolution: 15 minutes."

"The issue has been resolved. All services are operating normally. 
We will publish a post-mortem within 24 hours."

Internal Communication:
- Incident commander assigned
- War room established (Slack/Teams channel)
- Regular updates every 15 minutes
- Stakeholder notifications sent
- Customer support team briefed
```

## 5. Complex System Integration Debugging

### Microservices Troubleshooting

**Service Mesh Debugging**
```bash
# Service discovery issues
kubectl get services
kubectl describe service user-service
kubectl get endpoints user-service

# Network connectivity between services
kubectl exec -it pod-name -- curl http://user-service:8080/health
kubectl exec -it pod-name -- nslookup user-service

# Load balancing issues
kubectl get pods -l app=user-service
kubectl describe pod user-service-pod-name
kubectl logs user-service-pod-name
```

**API Gateway Troubleshooting**
```bash
# Check gateway configuration
curl -H "Host: api.example.com" http://gateway-ip/users
curl -v http://gateway-ip/users -H "Authorization: Bearer token"

# Trace request path
# Gateway → Authentication Service → User Service → Database
# Check each hop for issues

# Rate limiting debugging
curl -H "X-Rate-Limit-Key: user123" http://gateway-ip/users
# Check rate limit headers in response
```

**Message Queue Debugging**
```bash
# RabbitMQ debugging
rabbitmqctl list_queues name messages consumers
rabbitmqctl list_exchanges
rabbitmqctl list_bindings

# Check for dead letter queues
rabbitmqctl list_queues name messages | grep dlq

# Redis pub/sub debugging
redis-cli MONITOR
redis-cli PUBSUB CHANNELS
redis-cli PUBSUB NUMSUB channel_name
```

### Database Integration Issues

**Multi-Database Transactions**
```sql
-- Distributed transaction debugging
-- Check transaction logs
SELECT * FROM information_schema.innodb_trx;
SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS;

-- Deadlock analysis
SELECT * FROM information_schema.innodb_locks;
SELECT * FROM information_schema.innodb_lock_waits;

-- Replication lag monitoring
SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G
SELECT SECONDS_BEHIND_MASTER FROM information_schema.replica_host_status;
```

**Data Consistency Issues**
```bash
# Compare data between systems
# Primary database vs replica
mysql -h primary -e "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE created_at > '2024-01-01'"
mysql -h replica -e "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE created_at > '2024-01-01'"

# Cache vs database consistency
redis-cli GET "user:123"
mysql -e "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 123"

# Event sourcing debugging
# Check event store for missing events
# Verify event replay produces correct state
# Investigate event ordering issues
```

### Third-Party Integration Debugging

**API Integration Issues**
```bash
# Test external API directly
curl -X GET "https://api.external.com/users" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -w "@curl-format.txt"

# Check API rate limits
curl -I "https://api.external.com/users" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"
# Look for: X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset

# Monitor API health
while true; do
    curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %{time_total}\n" \
         "https://api.external.com/health"
    sleep 30
done
```

**Webhook Debugging**
```bash
# Test webhook endpoint
curl -X POST "https://your-app.com/webhooks/payment" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "X-Webhook-Signature: signature" \
     -d '{"event": "payment.completed", "data": {...}}'

# Webhook delivery debugging
# Check webhook provider logs
# Verify signature validation
# Test with ngrok for local development
ngrok http 3000
# Use ngrok URL for webhook testing
```

# 2. Identify error patterns
# Check each service logs for the same time period
kubectl logs -f user-service-pod
kubectl logs -f order-service-pod  
kubectl logs -f payment-service-pod

# 3. Trace specific requests
# Use correlation IDs to follow requests across services
grep "correlation_id=abc123" */logs/*.log

# 4. Check service health
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod failing-pod
kubectl top pods

# 5. Network connectivity testing
kubectl exec -it test-pod -- curl http://user-service:8080/health
kubectl exec -it test-pod -- nslookup payment-service

# 6. Database connection analysis
# Check connection pool status
# Monitor query performance
# Verify database health
```
